# Population vs Sample

To diving deeper of statistic topics, first of all you need to understand the difference between **Population** and **Sample**. Population is the set of all observations (individuals, procedures, events, or objects) and usually is very large and diverse. Sample is a subset of observations from the population that ideally is a true representation of the population. The figure bellow ilutrate the process more intuitive.

So, to make your experimental results more reliable and hold for the entire population, the sample needs to be true representation of the population. That is, the sample needs to be unbiased. In other words, if your sample don't represent the true repesentation, you have to use some statistical sampling techniques (e.g. Random Sampling, Systematic Sampling, Clustered Sampling, Wheighted Sampling, or Stratified Sampling).
